# 0.1

## 20th July, 2008

First public release.
The library does have several known issues and lacks some features I would like it to have, but it does
offer basic functionality and should be usable for people interested in working with DICOM files in Ruby.
The reading algorithm has been tested successfully with some 40 different DICOM files, so it should be fairly robust.
